1) What is Binary Search Tree
Ans: 
    A binary search tree (BST) is a data structure that allows for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations. 
    
    It is called a "binary" search tree because:

    -> The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
    -> The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.

2) Operations:
              -> Insert (Manually)
              -> Search (Manually)
              -> Array to  BST (Visualization)

2) BST Insertion Theory + Complexity + Implementation
   Insert + Delete + Search :O(height) Random Order insertion - O(logn)
                                       Sorted Order insertion - O(n)
