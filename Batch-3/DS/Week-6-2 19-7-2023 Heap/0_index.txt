1) What is Heap?
Ans: Tree based(Complete Binary Tree) sequential/ linear data structure.
Ans: 
    Simple and Powerful Data Structure.
    Varient of Binary Tree (Complete Binary Tree)
    
    Operation:
            -> Insert - O(logn) where BST support insertion around - O(h) [O(n) or O(logn)]
            -> Deletion - O(logn)
            -> get Max Value (Max Heap) / Min Value (Min Heap) - O(1)
            -> Extract Max // O(logn)
            -> Build heap form array (insert O(n))
            -> Heap Sort

    Type of Heap:
                1) Max Heap (Return max value at O(1) time) - (up-heapify)
                   Property: root value > child value
                2) Min Heap (Return min value at O(1) time) - (down-heapify)
                   Property: root value < child value

    Relation between parent and child:
    Parent : (index - 1)/2
    Child : 2*index + 1 (Left child)
            2*index + 2 (Right child)
    Last Non Leaf Node : n/2-1 [ Where n = number of nodes]
2) What is Complete Binary tree?
3) Array representaiton of Complete Binary tree.
4) Insertion
5) Deletion
6) Array to Heap Convertion
