append(): Not valid for tuples because it modifies the tuple, and tuples are immutable.

clear(): Not valid for tuples because it modifies the tuple, and tuples are immutable.

copy(): Valid for tuples. It creates a shallow copy of the tuple, which means it returns a new tuple with the same elements.

count(): Valid for tuples. It counts the number of occurrences of a specified element in the tuple.

insert(): Not valid for tuples because it modifies the tuple, and tuples are immutable.

pop(): Not valid for tuples because it modifies the tuple, and tuples are immutable.

remove(): Not valid for tuples because it modifies the tuple, and tuples are immutable.

sort(): Not valid for tuples because it modifies the tuple, and tuples are immutable.

reverse(): Not valid for tuples because it modifies the tuple, and tuples are immutable.
