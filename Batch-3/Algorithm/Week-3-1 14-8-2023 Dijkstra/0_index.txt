Single Source Shortest Path(SSSP)
=================================

BFS:
    Possible:
                  UnWeighted 
                  Undirected + Directed
                  Non-Negative Node + Non-negative edge weight
    ImPossible:
                  Weighted 
                  Negative Node + Negative edge weight
                  
                  Solution:
                  Dijkstra  (weighted edge)
                  Bellman-Ford algorithm it can be possible (Negative edge weight)
